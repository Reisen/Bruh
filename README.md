# BRUH - Another Python IRC Bot

## Installing

The bot depends only on Python 3.3+. To install, clone the repo or download the
zip from [here](https://github.com/Reisen/PyBruh/archive/master.zip). That's
it, just run **python main.py** to generate a default configuration file with
the bare minimum of settings. Edit the config with any changes you think you'll
need, then run the bot again.

There are a lot of configuration options for the bot, there's a more detailed
page on what you can do [here](https://github.com/Reisen/Bruh/wiki/Config).

## Usage

View a list of commands with `.help list`. There is also a wiki page on using
the bot [here](https://github.com/Reisen/Bruh/wiki). There is an instance of
this bot running on Rizon with some slightly more specialised plugins not
included in the bot core, for information about that see the page on
[Walnut][https://github.com/Reisen/Bruh/wiki/Walnut].
