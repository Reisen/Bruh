** NOT!!!!! Just Another IRC Bot**

## Installing

The bot depends only on Python 3 and greater. To install, clone the repo or
download the zip from
[here](https://github.com/Reisen/PyBruh/archive/master.zip). That's it, just
run **python main.py**to generate a default configuration file with the bare
minimum of settings. Edit the config with any changes you think you'll need,
then run the bot again.

## Plugins and Development

There's a short explanation of how the bot is laid out on the Github wiki, and
another short explanation on what's possible in plugins and how to write them.
